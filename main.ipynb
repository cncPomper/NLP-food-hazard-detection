Persons who have an allergy or severe\n      sensitivity to soy protein run the risk of possible allergic reactions if\n      they consume this product.\n      The product being recalled is 15-ounce cans of \"Chef BOYARDEE 99%\n      Fat Free CHEESE Ravioli in Tomato Sauce,\" which actually contain\n      15-ounces of beef ravioli. The bottom of each can bears the establishment\n      code \"794,\" followed by the case code \"J17101 RF.\"\n      The ravioli was produced on Oct. 17, 2001 and distributed to retail\n      establishments nationwide. The product was also exported to Haiti,\n      Guatemala and Bermuda.\n      \"We urge consumers, especially those allergic or sensitive to soy,\n      to check their cupboards and pantries,\" said Margaret OK.

In restaurants, they should ask whether an allergy-causing\n    ingredient is in the food. \n    A food allergy occurs when the immune\n    system reacts to a certain food, usually within minutes after the food has been consumed. \n    Symptoms may include throat swelling,\n    trouble breathing, or a rash. \n    Strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food\n    is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction. \n    Several foods account for 90% of allergic\n    reactions. They include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs,\n    milk, soy, and wheat. \n    Persons who have a severe, life-threatening\n    food allergy should always carry, and know how to administer, prescription epinephrine.",

         "Product withdrawal of Dasani bottled still water Friday 19 March 2004 Category D: For information only Ref: 12/2004 Heads of Environmental Health Services and Directors of Trading Standards will wish to be aware of a product withdrawal by The Coca-Cola Company of their Dasani brand bottled still water. The product has been found to contain raised levels of bromate, which exceed the permitted quantity stated in the Natural Mineral Water, Spring Water and Bottled Drinking Water Regulations 1999 as amended. The product has been on sale throughout the UK in retail outlets and from vending machines. The product recalled is: All Dasani bottled still water No other Coca Cola products are known to be affected Local authorities may wish to refer to the Food Standard Agency's web statement and Q&A regarding Dasani water attached below. The Coca-Cola Company has issued a press statement (see attached). In addition a consumer care line has been set up by the company, the number for which is: 0800 227 711. Product withdrawal statement issued by the Coca-Cola Company Voluntary withdrawal of Dasani in UK 11.45 am Friday 19 March To ensure that only products of the highest quality are provided to our consumers, Coca-Cola is voluntarily withdrawing all Dasani products currently in the marketplace in the UK. The withdrawal began on Friday, 19 March 2004, and will be 80-85 per cent completed within 24 hours. Calcium is a legal requirement in all bottled water products in the UK, including Dasani. To deliver the required calcium, we add back calcium chloride into the product. Through detailed analysis, we discovered that our product did not meet our quality standards. Because of the high level of bromide contained in the calcium chloride, a derivate of bromide, bromate, was formed at a level that exceeded UK legal standards. This occurred during the ozonisation process we employ in manufacturing. Immediately after we identified this issue, we consulted with the Food Standards Agency. The FSA has confirmed that there is no immediate health or safety issue. The withdrawal is a precautionary measure. If consumers have concerns or wish to return product purchased they should contact the free phone consumer care line 0800 227 711. The care line number appears on all Dasani packs. We are working closely with all our stockists to remove the product from the marketplace. This withdrawal only affects Dasani in the UK market. Our consumers rightly expect that our products meet only the highest possible standards for quality as well as all UK regulations.

In restaurants, they should ask whether an allergy-causing ingredient is in the food.\n                                              \nA food allergy occurs when the immune system reacts to a certain food, usually within minutes after the food has been consumed.\n                                              \nSymptoms may include throat swelling, breathing trouble or a rash.\n                                              \nStrictly avoiding the allergy-causing food is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction.\n                                              \nSeveral foods account for 90% of allergic reactions. They include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, and wheat.\n                                              \nPersons who have a severe, life-threatening food allergy should always carry, and know how to administer, prescription epinephrine.\n                                              \n                                          \n                                                                               \n                                                                            \n                                    \n The products were produced on various dates in September 2005, December 2005, January 2006 and February 2006 and sold to retail establishments nationwide.\n                                  \n National Custom Packaging, Inc., a Castroville, Calif., establishment (Est. 21340) serves as the co-packer for Unilever United States, Inc.s Bertolli brand products and packaged these products subject to recall.\n                                  \n The problem was discovered by a supplier who then notified the company. FSIS has had no reports of illness due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an allergic reaction should contact a physician.\n                                  \n Consumers with questions about the recall should call the Bertolli toll-free recall hotline at (866) 837-7592.
